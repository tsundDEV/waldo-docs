## Roadmap

![Roadmap](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903734052996128778/906660920552464394/Frontendroadmap.png)
## [Web Application](#)
>  We are using React.js as our framework. Find out more [here.](#)
>  Stack Structure:
>> ```
>> GitHub Pages
>> L React.js
>>```
>
> ###### *Hosting subject to change when the [deaktop app](#) is ported online, [learn more.](#)*


## [Electron Application](#)
> WALDO is choosing electron.js due to its ease of interchangeable internal structure, once an app is built on it, it can easily be ported online with smaller tweaks than it would have been if it was developed the traditional way. Find out more [here.](#)
> Stack Structure:
>> ```
>> electron.js
>>	L express.js
>>		L react.js
>> L Child Process for running python/c++  (Analysis Development)
>> ```

## [Docs Application](#)
> We are choosing [Docusaurus](#) as our documentation app powered by react. It is a simple and powerful way for all teams to add content to WALDO's documentation. 
>> Docusaurus `(Docusaurus v2.0.02-beta3)` 
>> Due to compatibility issues with Docusaurus, we are using using an older version of Docusaurus.
>> Thanks for your patience.
